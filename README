This repo stores my solutions to some leetcode problems. 

#Usage: 

Run "./new \${fileName} \${functionName}" 
in the project directory to initialize solution for a new problem.

This will create a new solution file and a new test file with the 
correct file and function naming conventions.

Example: "./new can_jump_II jump"
